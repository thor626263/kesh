Mujhe bhi ye acchi lagti hai ki ye bilkul natural hai aur ayurvedic ingredients se bana hua hai. Main iss hair oil ko definitely use karti rahungi.`,

Ye bahut light hai aur jaldi absorb hon jaata hai, meri baal ko soft aur healthy bana deta hai. Mainne dekha hai ki meri baal ke breakage aur split ends bhi bahut kam ho gaye hain Keshroot se use karne se. Main iss hair oil ko bahut recommend karti hoon.`,
